# middayCommand
Implementation of Mid-Day Commander for CS 3013
This project implements the midday command interface
v0 is a basic interface with only 3 commands accepted
v1 is a more advanced version where the user can add their own commands.
Additionally for v1, the user may pipe in a file.
v2 adds the ability to run user added commands in the background.
In order to track these background commands a linkedlist is used which holds all
currently running jobs.

To test each program I manually tested every command.
