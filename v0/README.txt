After an unnecessary amount of time, I was still not able to get ls to work correctly for part 1.
I did my best, but as it currently stands the program just doesn't know how to read input.
All the OS related concepts make sense up to this point, but I'm really struggling with I/O.
Anyways, here is my midday commander in which 0 and 1 work, and 2 does not.

For this version of the readme, I don't want to go into the algorithms too far because they
aren't that intense yet.
